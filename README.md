#Loan and Credit Risk Modeling

This project involves building and evaluating a supervised machine learning model to assess loan risk. The core task is to develop a Logistic Regression model using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending service. The model aims to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. The challenge includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and thorough model evaluation to ensure reliable predictions.
